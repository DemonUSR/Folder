Open "index.html" page on chrome or any browser you like.

Open in smartphone browser in portrait mode,otherwise everything will mess up.

This is my first project so it's not that much dynamic to run on both portrait and landscape mode.

Obviously it is not made for landscape mode so it won't run properly in PC's at all.

Don't open it with any editor.

After webpage load --

you can click on upper-right corner for more options.
